  "description": "Puppet module to install a JDK from the RPM binary distribution from oracle using wget.\nBased on the https://github.com/tylerwalts/puppet-jdk_oracle this module removed support for JDK6 and the tgz installer.\n\nSource: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\n\n_Note:  By using this module you will automatically accept the Oracle agreement to download Java._\n\nThis module will work on Redhat family of OSs, and will use wget with a cookie to automatically grab the RPM installer from Oracle.\n\nThis approach was inspired by: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10268583/how-to-automate-download-and-instalation-of-java-jdk-on-linux",
